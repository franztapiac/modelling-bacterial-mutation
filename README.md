# Modelling antibiotic resistance development
[Replicating research results] In silico modelling of the temporal development of antibiotic resistance in a growing bacteria population.

This project was done in partnership with Hilke Schenkel ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hilke-schenkel-0106411bb/)) to complete the course Modelling Dynamical Systems (NB4050) for university credits at the Delft University of Technology.

This project and the model were based on the research article 'On the rapidity of antibiotic resistance evolution facilitated by a concentration gradient' by Hermsen et al. (1). We aimed to replicate the model, given the design but no programming code, from the research publication.
